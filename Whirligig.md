## Settings in ScriptPlayer

When you try to connect to Whirligig for the first time (via Playback - Whirligig) you will see a promt that asks you for connection settings like the IP and port for the Whirligig timecode server. (default is ``127.0.0.1:2000``)

You can change these settings later in the settings dialog.
