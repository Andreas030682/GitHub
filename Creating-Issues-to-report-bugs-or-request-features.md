# How to report bugs?

When you want to report a bug, please follow the below steps:

* Check the [Troubleshooting Wiki-Page](https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer/wiki/Troubleshooting) to see if there is an easy solution for your problem.
* Make sure noone else already reported the bug by checking the [Issues](https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer/issues) page.
* Download the [latest build from AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/FredTungsten/scriptplayer)(Configuration: Debug -> Artifacts), maybe it has already been fixed.

If the issue you have is still reproducable, not fixed and not reported, please include (at least) the following information:

* What's the problem?
* How often does it happen?
* What version are you using and on what OS?
* Any other external problems involved?
* Steps to reproduce?
* If the program crashes, include the latest entry from your crash.log file (``%APPDATA%\\ScriptPlayer\\Crash.log``)

# Are Typos a Bug?

Yes - please report those too!

# Feature Requests

You can of course request new features, but please be as specific as possible. I do not handle requests to support additional devices / external programs but I might be able to forward requests like that to other developers.
