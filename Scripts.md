## Where to get them

[From me](https://github.com/FredTungsten/Scripts) (Cock Hero and Fap Hero videos), [Funjack](https://github.com/funjack/funscripts) (Mainstream Porn) or [this forum](http://realtouchscripts.com/viewforum.php?f=53).

## How to make them

With [VideoSync](https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer/tree/master/ScriptPlayer/ScriptPlayer.VideoSync) (Once it's usable I'll write a manual) or [Funjack's Blender plugin](https://github.com/funjack/launchcontrol/releases)

## Formats

### FunScript

FunScript was designed by FunJack for the Fleshlight Launch. It's basically a series of positions mapped to timestamps in the video. A detailed explanation can be found [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/funjack/launchcontrol/protocol/funscript).

### Beat Files

A list of timestamps (in seconds) that indicate an up/down movement saved in a text-file.  
Example: 

> 60.039  
> 60.506  
> 60.973  
> 61.440  
> 61.924  
> 62.391  
> 62.842  

### VirtualRealPorn Scripts

A ini-style text file that wraps the commands for compatible devices (e.g. Kiiroo Onyx)

### FeelMe Meta files

Same basic Kiiroo commands as in the VRP Scripts but wrapped in JSON

### Vorze Scripts

CSV Vorze Scripts are theoretically supported but the conversion is not working very well at the moment.
