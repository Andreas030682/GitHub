## Where to get them

[From me](https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer/tree/master/Scripts) (Cock Hero and Fap Hero videos) or [Funjack](https://github.com/funjack/funscripts) (Mainstream Porn).

## How to make them

With [VideoSync](https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer/tree/master/ScriptPlayer/ScriptPlayer.VideoSync) (Once it's usable I'll write a manual), with [Funjack's Blender plugin](https://github.com/funjack/launchcontrol/releases)

## Formats

### FunScript

FunScript was designed by FunJack for the Fleshlight Launch. It's basically a series of positions mapped to timestamps in the video. A detailed explanation can be found [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/funjack/launchcontrol/protocol/funscript).

### Beat Files

A list of timestamps (in seconds) that indicate an up/down movement saved in a text-file.  
Example: 

> 60.039  
> 60.506  
> 60.973  
> 61.440  
> 61.924  
> 62.391
