Make sure to read the [[installation manual|Installation#Prerequisites]] first, it covers the most basic prerequisites that are absolutely mandatory.

## I can't connect to my toy
Make sure you have at least the Windows version recommented in [[the installation manual|Installation#Prerequisites]], check if your bluetooth dongle supports BT 4.0 Low Energy and is [[not listed|Devices#ble-dongle-chipsets]] under the chipsets known to cause issues.

## I can connect my toy but it doesn't move
Make sure you have the latest version of ScriptPlayer, Buttplug (for devices other than the Fleshlight Launch) and your device's firmware (Launch can be updated with the FeelConnect app). Select "Source" - "Slow" in the settings menu to make sure it's not just a faulty script.

## Manual movement works, but I can't playback scripts
Make sure the script loaded successfully by enabling "Show Heatmap" in the [[settings panel|Settings]]. If the progressbar at the bottom stays black, the script was not loaded correctly.
