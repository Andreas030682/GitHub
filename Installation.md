## Prerequisites

* Windows 10 (Creators Update*) for all features
* Windows 7 or newer for basic features
* BLE capable dongle ([[List of tested chipsets|Devices#BLE dongle chipsets]])
* .Net Framework 4.6.2

\* Run the "System Information" application, and in the "System Summary", make sure the version says "10.0.15063 Build 15063". If it's a number lower than 15063, that means ScriptPlayer won't work for you with the Launch. Note that some machines (like certain Microsoft Surface models) may not have automatically updated to the Creators update yet. It could also be that your machine has updates turned off, in which case you can check for the creators update at [support.microsoft.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/d4efb316-79f0-1aa1-9ef3-dcada78f3fa0/get-the-windows-10-creators-update).

## Installation and Usage

* Make sure you have at least Firmware Version 1.3 on your Launch, if not - please update via the FeelConnect app
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer/releases) and extract/install it to a directory of your choice
* For devices other than the Fleshlight Launch (or when using a OS olter than Windows 10 Creators update), download and install [Buttplug](http://github.com/metafetish/buttplug-csharp/releases)
* Read [this](https://metafetish.club/t/using-buttplug-with-scriptplayer/68)
* Start ScriptPlayer and let it register for BLE access (Setup should already have taken care of that)
* Customize your [[Settings]]
* Get yourself some [[Scripts]] and the corresponding videos
* Familiarize yourself with the [[Controls]]
* Enjoy
